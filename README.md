# Payment-Gateway
A payment gateway is a technology used by merchants to accept debit or credit card purchases from customers. 
The term includes not only the physical card-reading devices found in brick-and-mortar retail stores but also the payment processing portals found in online stores. 
However, brick-and-mortar payment gateways in recent years have begun accepting phone-based payments using QR codes or Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.
